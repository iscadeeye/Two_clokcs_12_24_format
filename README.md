##### Summary of the project and what problem it is solving.
* This project gets the current local time and creates two clocks. It creates 12 and 24 formatted clocks. 
First, the project display menu options for a user. It gives the user the options to 
increase both clocks by adding one hour, one minute, or one second repectively or to quit the prograrm.
##### What did I d do well?
* Some of the things that I am proud of in this project are:
  * The way functions communicate each other. I think this is great achievement for me because when I started learning programming, I have had hard time 
  processing function calls and the flow of program execution.
  * I managed to minimize the code inside the main.cpp by assigning each task a function that does just that task. Whenever I need to do certain task,
  I just invoke the function that does it.
  * Incline comments: incline comments not only help understand other people who may read my code, but comments also 
   will come to my aid in the future to remind me what each piece of code does.
   ##### Where could I enhance my code? How would these improvements make my code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   * Of course, my code needs a lot of improvements. One thing I do is to create a clock class, and out of that class, create two object clocks, namely 12 and 24 clocks. In this way, my project will take advantage of the OOP principles and it would become more maintainable, less lines of code because of the capability of the OOP polymorphism principle, and it would become more reusable.
